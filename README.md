I'm an aspiring full-stack developer with self-taught and educational coding experience. All coding projects are built solo from the ground up, including the front-end itnerface on certain projects built using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation). Other codes are fully in console, but I have hopes of integrating more with front-end interface.
