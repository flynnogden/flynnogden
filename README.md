I'm an aspiring full-stack developer with self-taught and educational coding experience. All coding projects are built solo from the ground up, including the front-end itnerface on certain projects built using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation). Other codes are fully in console, but I have hopes of integrating more with front-end interface in the future.

  <summary><h3>🏄 My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I was first introduced to coding aged 13 during a computer science GCSE taster session where I immediately fell in love. From there I took GCSE computer science where the course was 50/50 theory and coding. Whilst I didn't mind the theory, I much preferred and excelled at the coding, often doing more Python (the language we used) at home for fun to develop my own small programs. During this time, I secured a work experience placement at one of the UK's biggest tech firms - Arm. This placement led to me using front-end tools to create a UI for an app I designed, as well as various other tech related activities. After finishing the course I went on to Sixth Form, where I didn't do computer science, as the tier one college I went to had high entry requirements for Computer Science, which I, unfortunately, did not qualify for. Nevertheless, after this my flame for coding had not yet diminished so I continued learning Python in my spare time, eventually moving over to a new language - C#! Ever since I've partaken in multiple online courses and produced my own projects to develop my C# skills and am looking to eventually take on more languages, as well as front-end development tools. Luckily, I am a quick learner so find learning new languages easy!
